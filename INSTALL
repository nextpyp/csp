Installing CSP
--------------

1. Run the configuration script 
   ./configure.sh. /PATH/TO/FREALIGN/EXECUTABLE/frealign_v8.exe
   
   This creates the ./bin/ folder, runs cmake to create the Makefile,
   and link the FREALIGN executable where CSP needed it.

2. Run ./make_csp.sh to build the framework, the executable is
   ./bin/csp

3. Link the frealign executable frealign_v8.exe in the FREALIGN
   folder. See next section and read the output of the configure.sh

To run an experiment, set the configuration in parameters.config,
prepare the data files and run it with run_csp_experiment.sh. Read
README for more information.


FREALING installation
---------------------

The scripts to run FREALING are included in this release and are
located in the ./frealign/ folder (${CSP_DIR}/frealign).

The scripts have variations with respect to their last version. I'd
tried to reduce the amount of these variations to maintain "backwards
compatibility". The main change is that SPA_DIR should be the folder
where this folder, i.e. the folder where the CSP scripts are located,
CSP_DIR as is referred in the README file.

In order to be able to run FREALING, CSP expected to find the
executable in the ${CSP_DIR}/frealign folder. Then it must be linked
or copied to this folder. The full path to the executable is given as
the parameter to the configuration script.

Also CSP_DIR is redefined in the run_usp_experiment.sh and
run_frealign_*.sh scripts. This is done automatically.
